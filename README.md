# EC3 Excel Dump
_Current version: v0.1.0_

The goal for this project is to decipher Excel files and generate the
proper databases and reports from these files. The current focus are
the EC3 dumps that arrive every month. These files are read and
inserted into the database from where we can perform various
operations and create presentations that Excel, otherwise, cannot
accomplish simply.
